            <h3>Core Research Thrusts &amp; Applications</h3>
            <p class="text">
              Our research activities are diverse, yet interconnected by the common goal of creating more intelligent,
              reliable, and efficient learning agents. Key areas of focus include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Control:</strong>
                Developing methods that can learn effective control policies with minimal data, crucial for physical
                systems where data collection is expensive or time-consuming. This has direct applications in robotics
                and automated control systems, such as those found in particle accelerators.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Safe Reinforcement Learning:</strong>
                This is a critical area, ensuring that RL agents operate within specified safety constraints during
                learning and execution. Our interests here are twofold:
                <ul>
                  <li>Developing sample-efficient methods that inherently respect safety boundaries.</li>
                  <li>Addressing high-stake problems where failures can have significant consequences, including
                    applications in medical treatment planning, critical infrastructure control, and autonomous
                    robotics.</li>
                  <li>Exploring the theoretical underpinnings of safe exploration and exploitation.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Hard Discrete Optimization Problems:</strong>
                Applying RL techniques to find solutions for complex optimization tasks that are computationally
                challenging for traditional methods, such as logistics, scheduling, and resource allocation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>RL in Physics and Control Systems:</strong>
                Leveraging my background to apply RL for optimizing and controlling complex physical systems. This
                includes ongoing collaborations with leading research institutions like CERN (e.g., for projects like
                AWAKE [[9]](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1651538)), DESY, KIT, and GSI, focusing on areas like
                particle accelerator operations and experiment control.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">
              The ultimate aim is to contribute to the development of AI systems that can learn, adapt, and make sound
              decisions in the face of real-world complexities, thereby augmenting human capabilities and driving
              innovation across various scientific and industrial domains.
