                <p class="text">
                    This dossier presents an exhaustive analysis of the research profile, academic trajectory, and
                    industrial activities of Dr. Simon Hirländer. Currently serving as the Head of the <strong>"Smart
                        Analytics & Reinforcement Learning" (SARL)</strong> team at the Intelligent Data Analytics (IDA)
                    Lab at Paris Lodron University Salzburg (PLUS), Dr. Hirländer occupies a unique niche at the
                    convergence of high-energy theoretical physics and modern artificial intelligence.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Dr. Hirländer’s career is characterized by a <span class="highlight-text">"theory-to-application"
                        pipeline</span>. His foundational work involves rigorous mathematical physics—specifically the
                    modeling of electromagnetic interactions in particle accelerators using complex Green
                    functions—which he developed during his doctoral tenure at CERN and TU Wien. This theoretical
                    bedrock has evolved into a specialized focus on <strong>Reinforcement Learning (RL)</strong> for the
                    control of complex, non-linear dynamical systems. He is a pivotal figure in the movement towards
                    "Autonomous Accelerators," leading international collaborations to automate the world’s largest
                    machines, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the AWAKE experiment.

                <p class="text">
                    Beyond academia, Dr. Hirländer has established a robust portfolio of industrial technology transfer.
                    He applies the safety-critical, high-precision control methods developed for proton synchrotrons to
                    diverse industrial sectors, including dental medical technology (W&H), steel manufacturing
                    (Danieli), and energy optimization (Copa-Data). This report details his methodological innovations,
                    including Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) and Deep Meta-RL, and documents his extensive
                    footprint in teaching and community building through initiatives like the "RL Coffee" and
                    international bootcamps.

                        <strong>Note regarding the "Gamper" association:</strong> An analysis of the available research
                        data indicates that while the initial query juxtaposed "Simon hirlaender/Gamper," there is no
                        evidence of a collaborative research relationship between Dr. Hirländer and a researcher named
                        Gamper in the domains of physics or AI. References to "Simon Gamper" point to a composer or an
                        IT service role at ZHAW, and "Johann Gamper" appears as a session chair in related conferences.
                        Consequently, this report focuses exclusively on the verified, extensive research corpus of Dr.
                        Simon Hirländer.

                <h3>1.2 Educational Pedagogy and Foundations</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    Dr. Hirländer’s transition into Artificial Intelligence is distinguished by his background in
                    rigorous theoretical physics. Unlike data scientists who approach problems purely from a statistical
                    perspective, Hirländer approaches AI from the perspective of dynamical systems and field theory.

                    The continuity in his education—from Green functions in capacitors (MSc) to Green functions in
                    particle accelerators (PhD)—demonstrates a long-standing specialization in modeling electromagnetic
                    fields, which he later learned to control using neural networks.

                <h2 class="add-top-margin">2. Doctoral Research: Theoretical Physics and Electromagnetism</h2>
                <p class="text">
                    To understand the sophistication of Dr. Hirländer’s AI architectures, one must first analyze the
                    complexity of the physical problems he solved analytically during his doctoral studies. His PhD
                    thesis, <em>Exact Solutions of Indirect Transverse Field Effects in Elongated Structures</em>,
                    addresses one of the fundamental limits of high-intensity particle accelerators: the "Indirect Space
                    Charge Driven" (ISCD) effect.
                </p>

                <h3>2.1 The Problem: Indirect Space Charge</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    In a particle accelerator like the LHC or the Proton Synchrotron (PS), a beam of charged particles
                    travels at near-light speeds inside a vacuum chamber (the beam screen). The beam carries a strong
                    electromagnetic field. This field interacts with the metallic walls of the vacuum chamber, inducing
                    image currents and charges. These induced charges, in turn, create a secondary electromagnetic field
                    that acts back on the beam. This "indirect" interaction can cause the beam to become unstable,
                    leading to a shift in the betatron tune (the frequency of the particle's oscillation) and
                    potentially causing beam loss.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Dr. Hirländer’s research identified that an appropriate quantitative explanation for the ISCD
                    tune-shift—which requires constant correction during LHC operation—was missing from the standard
                    models. His work specifically identified the electric interaction with the beam screen as the
                    primary origin of this tune shift.
                </p>

                <h3>2.2 Methodological Innovation: The Riemann-Sphere Operator</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    Modeling these interactions usually requires computationally expensive numerical simulations (Finite
                    Element Method). However, for real-time control and deep understanding, analytical (closed-form)
                    solutions are superior. Dr. Hirländer developed a novel mathematical framework to derive these
                    solutions.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Complex Green Functions:</strong> He utilized complex analysis to represent the
                        electrostatic potentials. Green functions are impulse response functions used to solve
                        inhomogeneous differential equations subject to boundary conditions (like the walls of the LHC
                        beam pipe).</li>
                    <li><strong>The Lorentz Operator on the Riemann Sphere:</strong> A central contribution of his
                        thesis was the derivation of a "novel Lorentz operator of the Green functions on the
                        Riemann-sphere (RS)". By mapping the complex geometry of the accelerator chamber onto the
                        Riemann sphere, he could simplify the calculation of the electromagnetic fields.</li>
                    <li><strong>Image Operators:</strong> From the Lorentz operator, he derived "image operators" for
                        arbitrary beam distributions. This allowed for the estimation of the ISCD tune-shift in complex
                        accelerator models without relying solely on numerical integration.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.3 Application to the LHC and PS</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    The practical application of this theoretical work was immediate and critical for CERN:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>LHC Beam Screen:</strong> He proved a novel method to approximate the fundamental
                        electrostatic field of arbitrary simply-connected domains, applying it to the "rect-elliptical"
                        geometry of the LHC beam screen. This closed-form model provided agreement with measurements
                        with "unprecedented accuracy" and is applicable to the future High Luminosity (HL)-LHC, where
                        these effects will be double the current magnitude.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Turn Extraction (MTE) in the PS:</strong> In the Proton Synchrotron, a process
                        called Multi-Turn Extraction splits the beam into a main beam and four "islands" or beamlets.
                        Measurements had shown an unexplained intensity dependence in the beamlet positions. Hirländer’s
                        analytical calculations and simulations resolved this dependence as being caused by ISCD
                        effects.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text">
                    This body of work established Dr. Hirländer as an expert in the underlying dynamics of the machines
                    he would later seek to automate.
                </p>

                <h2 class="add-top-margin">3. The Paradigm Shift: Reinforcement Learning in Particle Physics</h2>
                <p class="text">
                    Following his PhD, Dr. Hirländer’s research focus shifted from modeling these dynamics to
                    controlling them using Machine Learning. This transition marks the beginning of the "Autonomous
                    Accelerators" era in his career. His research argues that while analytical models (like his own) are
                    powerful, the operational complexity of machines like the LHC—with thousands of drifting
                    parameters—requires adaptive agents capable of learning from experience.
                </p>

                <h3>3.1 The "Sample Efficiency" Challenge</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    A recurring theme in Hirländer’s AI research is the problem of sample efficiency. In standard
                    Reinforcement Learning (e.g., training an agent to play a video game), the agent can fail millions
                    of times in a simulation. In a particle accelerator:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Beam time is expensive:</strong> Running the LHC costs immense amounts of energy and
                        money.</li>
                    <li><strong>Safety is critical:</strong> A "bad" exploration step by an AI agent could steer a
                        high-energy beam into the wall, damaging sensitive superconducting magnets.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text">
                    Therefore, Dr. Hirländer’s research specifically targets RL methods that learn quickly and safely.
                </p>

                <h3>3.2 Model-Based vs. Model-Free RL (The FERMI and LEIR Experiments)</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    One of his seminal contributions is the comparative analysis of Model-Free (MFRL) and Model-Based
                    Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) in accelerator environments.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The FERMI FEL Study:</strong> In a key paper titled "Model-free and Bayesian Ensembling
                        Model-based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Particle Accelerator Control Demonstrated on the
                        Fermi FEL", Hirländer and colleagues (Niky Bruchon, et al.) investigated intensity optimization
                        on the Free Electron Laser (FEL) at FERMI.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Methodology:</strong> They implemented a model-based algorithm in a "DYNA-style"
                                architecture using an uncertainty-aware model (Bayesian ensembling). This was compared
                                against a tailored Deep Q-Learning (Model-Free) approach.</li>
                            <li><strong>Findings:</strong> The study found that the Model-Based approach demonstrated
                                higher representational power and sample efficiency, making it superior for rapid tuning
                                where data is scarce. However, the Model-Free method showed slightly superior asymptotic
                                performance (it reached a better final solution given enough time).</li>
                            <li><strong>Noise Robustness:</strong> Both algorithms were engineered to handle the
                                significant noise omnipresent in accelerator diagnostics.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The LEIR Success:</strong> In the Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR), Hirländer led the "first
                        successful deep RL experiment" at CERN. Following the 2018 ion run, where numerical optimizers
                        were used to correct drifts, his team deployed Deep RL agents that could continuously recover
                        performance in the low-energy regime, effectively automating a task that previously required
                        constant human vigilance.</li>

                <h3>3.3 The AWAKE Project: Deep Meta-Reinforcement Learning</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    The AWAKE experiment (Advanced WAKEfield Experiment) is a frontier project accelerating electrons in
                    plasma wakes created by protons. It is highly unstable and non-linear, making it the perfect testbed
                    for Hirländer’s advanced RL concepts.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Trajectory Steering:</strong> The core problem was steering the electron beam to match
                        the proton beam's trajectory.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deep Meta-RL:</strong> In collaboration with S. Pochaba and C. Xu, Hirländer applied
                        Deep Meta-Reinforcement Learning. "Meta-learning" is learning to learn. The goal was to create
                        an agent that could adapt to "Linear Markov Decision Processes" that change over time (e.g., due
                        to thermal drifts in magnets).</li>
                    <li><strong>Impact:</strong> This research demonstrated that Meta-RL agents could achieve rapid
                        adaptation, correcting the beam trajectory in "few-shot" scenarios where traditional controllers
                        would lag or require recalibration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE):</strong> Hirländer utilized VAEs to compress the
                        high-dimensional input images from beam screens into a "latent space." This allowed the RL agent
                        to make decisions based on simplified, essential features rather than raw noisy pixels, a
                        crucial step for real-time control.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3.4 LHC Tune Feedback</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    In collaboration with Leander Grech and Gianluca Valentino, Hirländer applied RL to the LHC Tune
                    Feedback system. The "tune" (oscillation frequency) is a critical parameter for stability.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Challenge:</strong> The LHC's tune drifts due to magnet hysteresis and decay.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Solution:</strong> They reimplemented the original feedback controller (QFB) and
                        compared it against RL agents.</li>
                    <li><strong>Result:</strong> The RL agent's performance exceeded the classical controller-based
                        paradigm in simulated environments, proving that AI could potentially replace standard PID loops
                        in the world's most critical machine.</li>

                    A distinguishing feature of Dr. Hirländer’s profile is his aggressive pursuit of technology
                    transfer. He leverages the "Safe RL" and "Control Theory" expertise developed for CERN to solve

                    <li><strong>The RL Application:</strong> Dr. Hirländer’s team is applying RL to create an adaptive
                        controller for these drivers. An RL agent can learn the non-linear response of the piezo-ceramic
                        material and the load, adjusting the driving signal in microseconds to maintain cutting
                        efficiency while minimizing heat generation—a classic control problem solved with modern AI.

                        processes. Steel manufacturing involves extreme variables (temperature, viscosity of molten
                        metal, roller speeds). Traditional automation relies on look-up tables and PID control.
                        Hirländer’s work suggests the implementation of RL agents for process optimization, potentially
                        to control the speed of rolling mills or the cooling curves of steel, reducing waste and energy
                        consumption. The project involves Master's student Olga Mironova.</li>

                        demand (e.g., in a factory or smart building) and optimizes the usage of renewables or grid
                        power. This effectively turns a factory into a "smart agent" that negotiates its energy
                        consumption to minimize cost and carbon footprint.</li>

                        anti-sway and trajectory planning, is mathematically similar to beam steering. An RL agent can
                        learn to move a crane load from point A to point B without oscillation, compensating for wind
                        and hydraulic non-linearities. This represents a direct translation of Hirländer’s "trajectory
                        steering" work at AWAKE to heavy machinery.</li>

                <h2 class="add-top-margin">5. Methodological Innovations in AI</h2>
                <p class="text">
                    Dr. Hirländer’s research is not merely the application of existing tools; it involves the
                    development of new algorithmic variations tailored for physical systems.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Python-Simulink Bridging:</strong> In the paper "Python-Based Reinforcement Learning on
                        Simulink Models", Hirländer addresses a major engineering hurdle. Most industrial control
                        systems are designed in MATLAB/Simulink, while modern RL is done in Python (PyTorch/TensorFlow).
                        His team developed robust interfaces to allow Python agents to train on Simulink digital twins,
                        facilitating the deployment of academic AI into legacy industrial environments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Probabilistic Deep Learning and Uncertainty:</strong> A core tenet of his philosophy is
                        that AI must be "uncertainty aware." In the paper "Uncertainties in deep models - probabilistic
                        deep learning", he explores methods to quantify the confidence of an RL agent. If an agent is
                        "uncertain" about a state (e.g., an unknown beam configuration), it should act cautiously. This
                        is implemented via Bayesian Neural Networks and Ensembling techniques, which are critical for
                        safety certification in both CERN and industrial contexts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Objective Optimization:</strong> Real-world systems rarely have a single goal. In
                        "Online multi-objective particle accelerator optimization of the AWAKE electron beam line",
                        Hirländer demonstrated algorithms that optimize for multiple conflicting objectives
                        simultaneously—such as maximizing beam transmission while minimizing emittance (spread). This
                        uses scalarization techniques or Pareto-front optimization within the RL reward function.</li>

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sustainable Industrial AI (Green AI):</strong> Through the FOCUS grant (running until
                        2028), he is positioning RL as a key enabler of industrial sustainability. By optimizing energy
                        grids and manufacturing processes, his algorithms directly contribute to carbon reduction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nautical Robotics:</strong> The NauROM project indicates an expansion into maritime
                        systems. The physics of fluids (water) shares mathematical similarities with the physics of
                        plasma/beams, allowing him to transfer his control theory expertise to autonomous boats and

                    Dr. Simon Hirländer stands as a exemplar of the modern "Physicist-Engineer." His work effectively
                    demystifies the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning in high-stakes environments. By proving
                    the mathematical bounds of stability in his PhD (ISCD effects) and then developing the AI agents
                    capable of navigating those bounds (Model-Based RL), he has created a cohesive research narrative.

                    His extensive industrial collaborations—from the precision of W&H dental tools to the massive scale
                    of Danieli steel mills—validate the universality of his approach: that complex dynamical systems,
                    whether subatomic or industrial, can be tamed through the intelligent, uncertainty-aware application
                    of Reinforcement Learning.
