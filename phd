It successfully bridges the gap between abstract mathematical physics (potential theory, conformal mapping) and practical engineering challenges at CERN (LHC tune-shifts, PS extraction). The work is highly rigorous, offering **closed-form analytical solutions** where previously only rough approximations or slow numerical simulations existed. Its primary achievement is resolving a known discrepancy in the LHC tune-shift predictions by a factor of two. ### **1. Scientific Contribution & Novelty** The thesis offers substantial innovation in how "Indirect Space Charge Driven" (ISCD) effects are modeled. ***New Mathematical Framework:** The author moves beyond standard planar geometry to working on the **Riemann-sphere**. This allowed for the derivation of a novel **Lorentz force operator** based on complex Green functions, which acts as an operator on conformal mappings.* **Novel Closed-Form Solutions:** ***LHC Beam Screen:** The thesis provides a closed-form approximation for the complex "rect-elliptical" shape of the LHC beam screen, proving that it can be accurately modeled as a rectangle using elliptic functions.* **PS Magnets:** It replaces the historical "parallel plate" approximation for the Proton Synchrotron (PS) combined-function magnets with new closed-form models derived by "opening the domain to infinity". ***N-Poles:** It provides general solutions for the Green and Neumann functions of n-pole structures (e.g., quadrupoles, octupoles).* **Error Bounds:** A significant theoretical contribution is the proof of a new method to approximate Green functions for arbitrary domains using in- and out-scribed polygons, providing a definitive **error bound** for the approximation. ### **2. Practical Impact on CERN Accelerators** The work is not purely theoretical; it has immediate and demonstrated applications to machine operation. ***LHC Tune-Shift Resolution:** Previous estimates of the indirect tune-shift at injection deviated from measurements by a factor of two. This work resolved that discrepancy, matching measurements with **unprecedented accuracy** (>99% agreement). This is critical for the stable filling of the machine.* **HL-LHC Predictions:** The model was extended to the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), predicting that ISCD effects will increase by a factor of two due to higher beam intensity, necessitating the corrections derived in this thesis. ***PS Multi-Turn Extraction (MTE):** The thesis explains the intensity-dependent position shifts of "beamlets" during extraction. It demonstrates that indirect space charge effects are the dominant cause and that electric and magnetic interactions are of similar magnitude in this regime. ### **3. Methodology and Rigor*** **Mathematical Rigor:** The derivation of the **generalized Neumann function** (for magnetic boundaries) and the classification of domains into bounded, unbounded star-like, and exterior is mathematically sophisticated. ***Verification:** The author meticulously validates his analytical models against measurements (Beam position monitors), numerical simulations (MAD-X and PTC tracking codes), and theoretical convergence studies. ### **4. Critique and Limitations*** **Complexity:** The mathematical framework (Riemann-sphere, Jacobi elliptic functions, hypergeometric functions) is dense. While necessary for "exact" solutions, it presents a high barrier to entry for practical accelerator physicists accustomed to simpler approximations. ***Scope of Coupling:** While the thesis mentions coupling effects, the linear approximation without coupling was deemed sufficient for the current explanation of physical effects. Future high-intensity regimes might require the full coupled treatment. ### **Conclusion** This is an **excellent doctoral thesis**. It solves a specific, high-value problem (LHC tune-shifts) while establishing a general mathematical toolbox (image operators on the Riemann-sphere) that can be applied to future accelerator designs. The transition from abstract potential theory to concrete operational parameters in the LHC control room is executed with impressive competence. --- ## User you rank as excellent, please give more info why and how excellent ## Gemini This thesis ranks as "excellent" because it achieves the "holy grail" of applied physics: it uses highly abstract, rigorous mathematics to solve concrete, critical engineering problems that simpler methods failed to resolve. Here is a detailed breakdown of why this work stands out, based on standard criteria for doctoral excellence: ### 1. Significant Original Contribution (The "Novelty" Factor) A standard PhD thesis often applies existing methods to a new system. This thesis creates a **new framework entirely**.* **The Riemann-Sphere Framework:** Accelerator physics typically models fields in a standard 2D complex plane. By moving the problem to the **Riemann-sphere** (a compactified complex plane that includes a point at infinity), the author uncovered symmetries and solutions that were invisible in the standard view. This is a profound theoretical leap, not just a calculation trick. ***New Mathematical Operators:** The derivation of a **Lorentz force operator** acting directly on conformal mappings is a novel theoretical tool. It allows for the "automation" of finding solutions for complex shapes, effectively creating a general engine for solving these problems rather than just solving them one by one. ### 2. Resolution of Long-Standing Discrepancies (The "Impact" Factor) The true test of a physics thesis is whether it matches reality better than previous attempts.* **LHC Tune-Shift:** There was a known factor-of-two discrepancy between the calculated and measured tune-shift (a critical stability parameter) in the Large Hadron Collider. This thesis **resolved that discrepancy**, achieving >99% agreement with measurements. This immediately validates the theoretical overhead. ***PS Multi-Turn Extraction:** The work provided the first quantitative explanation for the intensity-dependent position shifts observed in the Proton Synchrotron's "island" beams, proving that indirect space charge was the dominant driver. ### 3. Methodological Rigor (The "Precision" Factor) Many engineering theses rely on numerical approximations (simulations) without proving how accurate they are. This thesis provides **exact analytical proofs**.* **Closed-Form Solutions:** The author derived exact, closed-form equations (formulas you can write down, rather than needing a supercomputer to solve) for complex geometries like the "rect-ellipse" and "n-poles". Closed-form solutions are infinitely scalable and offer deeper physical insight than numerical grids. ***Error Bounds:** The thesis proves a theorem regarding **error bounds** for polygonal approximations. It mathematically proves that the true solution lies sandwiched between the solutions for an inscribed and an outscribed polygon. This gives engineers a guaranteed accuracy limit, which is rare and highly valuable in safety-critical machine operations. ### 4. Interdisciplinary Mastery The thesis demonstrates mastery of two distinct and difficult fields:* **Abstract Mathematical Physics:** Concepts like Green functions on Riemann surfaces, Dirichlet/Neumann problems, and conformal mapping of "unbounded star-like domains". * **Practical Accelerator Engineering:** Concrete operational challenges like the "closed orbit" in the PS, beam-screen interactions in the LHC, and magnet pole profiles. ### Summary of Excellence Most theses are either **theoretical** (new math, no application) or **applied** (simulations of a machine, no new math). This thesis is **both**. It invents new math to solve a real machine problem that was previously unsolvable with standard tools
